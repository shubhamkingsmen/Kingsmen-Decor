              Acrylic Finish
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              A high-gloss acrylic finish is the most luxurious option for a
              glass-like surface. This reflective finish really brings out the
              depth and vibrancy of colours and is perfect for modern,
              minimalist interiors. Often applied to cabinetry, furniture, and
              wall panels, a high-gloss acrylic finish gives a space an air of
              sleekness and sophistication while also making the spaces feel
              more expansive and airy.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              A matte acrylic finish is very subtle and understated in elegance.
              It gives a soft, velvety appearance that is perfect for
              contemporary designs. This finish diffuses light gently to give a
              refined and sophisticated look without the high shine of gloss.
              This is perfect for creating a warm, serene atmosphere in luxury
              spaces where understated luxury is key. This is suitable for
              walls, furniture, and accessories.
